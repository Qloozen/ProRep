# ProRep
Prorep is a sports application where you can track your exercises and schedule them over a week. For now this will be a iOS only application, made with SwiftUI. For this project I created a NestJS backend with a MySQL database to manage all the userdata. Authentication is handled by FirebaseAuth (Google sign in and email)

## Feature ideas & improvements
- Workout stopwatch/timer
- WatchOS interface to track your repetitions
- Graphs to showcase your progress
- Sharing exercises
- Localization
- Push notifications
- Tips/ AI integration
